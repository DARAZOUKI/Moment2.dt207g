# Work Experience Management Website
This project involves creating a standalone web application that consumes the web service created in Assignment 1. The web application should be a frontend-only solution, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
## Assignment Overview:
The assignment requirements are as follows:
 * Create a web application that consumes the web service created in Assignment 1.
    * The web application should be a frontend-only solution, not based on Express/EJS.
    * Implement functionality to display existing work experiences and add new ones via a form.
    * The website should have at least three pages:
        ** index.html: Display all work experiences in a list.
        ** add.html: Provide a form to add new work experiences.
        ** about.html: Describe the website's purpose and include information about the database server used.
    * Use Fetch API to perform GET, POST, and DELETE requests to and from the web service.
    * Build the solution using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, optionally using SASS/SCSS.
    * Publish the solution to a publicly accessible web host or provide a video demonstration.
    * Publish the source code to a GitHub repository.
    * Include a README file documenting the web application.

    ## Testing the Web Application:
   
    You can test the web application as follows:

    * Viewing Work Experiences: Visit the index.html page to view all existing work experiences fetched from the web service.

    * Adding a Work Experience: Navigate to the add.html page and fill out the form to add a new work experience. Submit the form, and the new experience will be added to the list.

    * Deleting a Work Experience: On the index.html page, each work experience should have a delete button. Click the delete button to remove the corresponding work experience from the list.

    ## Conclusion:

This assignment provided valuable experience in building a frontend web application that interacts with a backend web service. 
Understanding how to consume APIs using Fetch API and creating dynamic web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are essential skills for web development.
